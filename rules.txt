PROJECT DEVELOPMENT RULES
==========================

RULE #1: PRESERVE EXISTING FORMATTING
------------------------------------
NEVER modify existing page layouts, CSS classes, or component structures unless explicitly requested by the user. When adding new features or making changes:

- Keep all existing styling intact
- Maintain current layout structures
- Preserve existing component hierarchies
- Don't change CSS classes or Tailwind classes
- Don't modify existing component props or structure
- Only add new elements/components without touching existing ones

If formatting changes are needed, ask the user first and get explicit permission.

RULE #2: MAINTAIN DESIGN CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------
- Always use the established color scheme:
  * Sage green: #4F5D4E
  * Terracotta: #E07A5F
  * Light gray: #F4F4F4
  * Dark gray: #333333
- Use existing UI components from /components/ui/
- Follow the established typography patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing and padding

RULE #3: PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------------------
- Never break existing features when adding new ones
- Test that existing functionality still works after changes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Don't remove or modify existing API endpoints without permission

RULE #4: FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PATTERNS
------------------------------------
- Use the same file structure patterns
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use established TypeScript patterns
- Maintain consistent component organization

RULE #5: DATABASE INTEGRITY
---------------------------
- Always use Prisma for database operations
- Follow established schema patterns
- Use proper TypeScript types from /lib/lineage-types.ts
- Test database operations before implementing

RULE #6: ERROR HANDLING
-----------------------
- Always include proper error handling in API routes
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully

RULE #7: RESPONSIVE DESIGN
-------------------------
- Ensure all new components work on mobile and desktop
- Use Tailwind's responsive classes appropriately
- Test on different screen sizes

RULE #8: PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------------------
- Use proper loading states
- Implement efficient data fetching
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper React patterns (useEffect, useState, etc.)

RULE #9: SECURITY
-----------------
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication patterns when implemented
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Follow Next.js security best practices

RULE #10: DOCUMENTATION
-----------------------
- Update project.txt when adding major features
- Comment complex logic
- Keep README.md updated
- Document API endpoints

RULE #11: TESTING APPROACH
--------------------------
- Test new features thoroughly before considering them complete
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Check browser console for errors

RULE #12: COMMUNICATION
-----------------------
- Always ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
- Explain what changes will be made before implementing
- Provide progress updates on complex features
- Ask permission before making significant architectural changes

RULE #13: FILE ORGANIZATION
---------------------------
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent folder structures
- Don't move existing files without permission
- Follow the established app/ and components/ structure

RULE #14: VERSION CONTROL
-------------------------
- Make focused, single-purpose commits
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Don't commit broken code
- Test before committing

RULE #15: USER EXPERIENCE
-------------------------
- Prioritize user experience in all decisions
- Make interfaces intuitive and accessible
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns

CRITICAL REMINDER: When in doubt about formatting or layout changes, ASK FIRST. It's better to ask for permission than to break existing functionality.
